# perplexity

URL: https://www.perplexity.ai
Capabilities: chat, search, research.
Paths are relative to this skill's folder; build absolute paths from it.
Set `PROVIDER` to this folder and `ROUTER` to its sibling `10x-chat` folder.

## Steps

1. Follow [chat](../10x-chat/references/chat.md) with this provider.
2. Open the URL with `../10x-chat/bin/open.sh`. Keep the returned page ID.
3. Run `../10x-chat/bin/js.sh` with the page ID and `js/state.js`.
4. If `state.blocked` is set, load [wait-user](../10x-chat-wait-user/SKILL.md).
5. If `state.loggedIn=false`, load [login](../10x-chat-login/SKILL.md).
6. If `MODEL=best` or the name is unknown, load [best-model](../10x-chat-best-model/SKILL.md).
7. Apply the provider steps in Known quirks below. Check requested settings in a snapshot.
8. Run `js/insert.js` with `{"text":"the full prompt"}`. Check `ok=true` and `len`.
9. Run `js/send.js` once. Check `ok=true`. Keep the page open during generation.
10. Run `../10x-chat/bin/wait.sh` with the page ID and this folder.
    It runs `js/state.js` and `js/read.js`. Return the answer, links, and media URLs.
11. For a missing element or wrong result, use [debug provider](../10x-chat/references/debug-provider.md).

## Model ranking

Prefer the requested model for research. For best, prefer the newest Pro model, then Sonar Pro, then Sonar, then Auto. Research is a separate mode.

Open `js/open-models.js`, then list `js/models.js` and select with `js/pick-model.js`.
Use the shared best-model skill for ranking and cache rules.

## Known quirks

The sign-in popup can cover Submit. Check login and dialog state first. A visible composer can exist while signed out. For research, select Research from the composer mode menu before insertion. Read the last `.prose` block and include its source links.
